                <H2>Happy New Year!  Sunday, Dec. 31st, Northport!</H2>
                <p>It's the end of 2023 already!  We have had a lot of fun this year, visiting different places & playing new songs & 
                    meeting new fans!  Charlevoix, Central Lake, Kingsley, Northport, and of course Traverse City were all on our schedule 
                    this year, and we all have enjoyed every evening we have spent with all of you.  I can tell you, we're already putting together 
                    a fun schedule for 2024, but news on that will come later - for now, we still have one more gig to perform this year, the Grand 
                    Finale, our New Year's Eve celebration!  Just like last year, we'll be back at Northport Pub & Grill for the festivities, starting
                    at 8pm & going until after Northport does its 'Anchor Drop' at midnight!  Hope to see you there!</p>
                <h2>Happy Thanksgiving!  Saturday, Nov. 25th @ Cellar 1914 in Central Lake</h2>
                <p>We hope you were able to come & join us at MiddleCoast Brewing in TC on Thanksgiving weekend for some good wine, good music, and good times!  If not, go visit the Photo
                    Album & the Blog, to see what you missed!
